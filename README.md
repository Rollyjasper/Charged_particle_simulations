# charged_particle_simulation_project

A charged particle simulation created as part of a third year project at university.

Simulates charged particles using diffent numerical methods.

This is some of my most commented code as it was done as part of a group project thus, this was code that I shared with my peers.

Files:
- particles.py: Contains all the functions relating to the generation and manipulation of particles.
- visulization.py: Contains all the functions relating to the visulization of particles.
- enviroment.py: Contains all the functions relating to the enviroment of particles.
- main.py: Contains all code to run the simulation. Run this to run the simulation.
